DOWNLOAD BY CLICKING ON THE RELEASE TO THE RIGHT
All you need to do is download YouThinkYoureSafe.zip and place that file into your /.minecraft/resourcepacks/ folder. Make sure to enable the pack in-game and never disable it.

[ Features ]

This is a meme resource pack. I reccomend going into it blind, playing minecraft normally, and finding the features yourself.

Most of the things you should expect to see in this pack are included in changelog.txt, which is in the assets folder.
It also has some things that I plan to add, future ideas, dreams, memes, etc.
If you have any ideas you wanna see in this pack, speak up!
My discord is Golden_Obsidian#0780, sapnu puas.

[ Alternate textures ]

Oh no! Some people use the Programmer art resource pack, while other weirdos use the new textures added to the game.
This means that for some of the jokes in this pack, I've added two different files, one for each style.
For example, the folder "\assets\minecraft\textures\models\armor\" has two separate files,
and you can rename them to the proper filename to switch between them.
If you dont know what this means, dont worry! Just know that this pack works best with Programmer Art.

Here's a (probably) complete list of files that have the new textures included next to them:

\assets\minecraft\textures\models\armor\gold_layer_1.png

(this list is an overcomplicated stub because I havent yet changed enough files to make a complete list)
